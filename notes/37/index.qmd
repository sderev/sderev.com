### Run Black

```vim
:!black %
:e!
```

### Create a keybind to run Black and save file by adding this to your `.vimrc`

```vim
autocmd FileType python nnoremap <buffer> <leader>b :w<cr>:!black %<cr>:e!<cr>
```

By default, the `<leader>` key is the backslash `\` character. Mine is the spacebar key. You can remap it by adding the following line in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let mapleader=" "
```

If it fails to reformat the code, put Vim in the background by pressing `Ctrl + z` so that you can read the error message, and then just come back to Vim with the `fg` command.
