With all the hype around ChatGPT, now is a good time to finally read this paper from March 2022 by Shah & Bender:

**Situating Search (Shah & Bender, 2022):** <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498366.3505816>

**For a lay introduction to those ideas, see these press articles (directly recommended by Emily Bender):**

**Video series with Bender and Hanna talking about AI:** <https://videos.trom.tf/w/p/4gykGcMrmHHs7bG2Y6qK9W>

## ChatGPT is not the new Google we want for

Don't forget that **Google Search is not a search engine by design.** It lives to display ads; its content recommendation system is the honeypot.
