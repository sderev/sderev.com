The same options apply to both `grep` and `ripgrep` (`rg`).

## Show the Lines Before the Matching Lines

```bash
rg -B 3 "keyword" filename
```

## Show the Lines After the Matching Lines

```bash
rg -A 3 "keyword" filename
```

## Show the Lines Around the Matching Lines

```bash
rg -C 3 "keyword" filename
```
