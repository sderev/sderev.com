From the book *Programming Abstractions in C++*:

```cpp
if (test for simple case) {
    // Compute a simple solution without using recursion.
} else {
    // Break the problem down into subproblems of the same form.
    // Solve each of the subproblems by calling this function recursively.
    // Reassemble the subproblem solutions into a solution for the whole.
}
```
