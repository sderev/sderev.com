> An administrator can use **john** or **crack** (both are brute force password crackers) together with an appropriate wordlist to check users' passwords and take appropriate action when a weak password is detected. You can search for Debian GNU packages that contain word lists using apt-cache search wordlist, or visit the classic Internet wordlist sites such as ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists or ftp://ftp.cerias.purdue.edu/pub/dict.
