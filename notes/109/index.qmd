Vim's `:s` command lets you use substitution with regular expressions. While `/` is the common delimiter, you can use other characters (except for `\`, `"`, `|`). 

## Examples

### Standard Substitution

```vim
:s/foo/bar/g
```

### Same substitution with `#` as delimiter

```vim
:s#foo#bar#g
```

Using a different delimiter lets you avoid escaping slashes in patterns like file paths.

## Simplifying File Path Substitution

### With Escaping Slashes

```vim
:s/\/User\/local\/bin\//\/usr\/sbin\//g
```

### Using `#` as Delimiter

```vim
:s#/User/local/bin/#/usr/sbin/#g
```
