To rename a WSL distribution, you need to edit a registry key.

## Manually Edit the registry Key

1. Press `Win + r` and run `regedit.exe`
1. Search `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss\`
1. Locate the folder for the distribution you want to rename.
1. Edit the `DistributionName` key.

## Using a PowerShell Script

You may not have the permissions to execute a script in PowerShell. To verify your permissions, run the command `Get-ExecutionPolicy`.

If necessary, allow local script execution:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This allows the execution of local scripts without signatures while still requiring signatures for downloaded scripts.

### Script Description

The PowerShell script below automates the WSL distribution renaming. It first lists the current distributions with `wsl --list`. Then it prompts for the old and new names, and modifies the registry key. Finally, it displays the updated distribution list.

### The Script

```powershell
# Ensure you run this script as an administrator

function Show-WSLDistributions {
    Write-Host "`nCurrent WSL Distributions:"
    wsl --list
}

function Rename-WSLDistribution {
    param (
        [string]$oldName,
        [string]$newName
    )

    $lxssKey = "HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss"
    $distroKey = Get-ChildItem $lxssKey | 
        Where-Object { $_.GetValue("DistributionName") -eq $oldName } |
        Select-Object -First 1

    if ($distroKey) {
        Set-ItemProperty -Path $distroKey.PSPath -Name "DistributionName" -Value $newName
        Write-Host "`nWSL distribution renamed from $oldName to $newName"
        
        Write-Host "`nChecking if the change is visible..."
        Show-WSLDistributions
        
        Write-Host "`nIf you don't see the change reflected above, you may need to restart the WSL service or reboot your computer."
    } else {
        Write-Host "`nWSL distribution '$oldName' not found."
    }
}

# Main script
Write-Host "WSL Distribution Renaming Tool"
Write-Host "==============================`n"

Show-WSLDistributions

$oldName = Read-Host "`nEnter the name of the WSL distribution you want to rename"
$newName = Read-Host "Enter the new name for the distribution"

Rename-WSLDistribution -oldName $oldName -newName $newName
```
