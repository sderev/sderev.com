For whatever reason—as usual—, `xclip` and other program using the X-Server stopped working on my WSL installation. I just got the following error:

```bash
Error: Can't open display: :0
```

Restarting WSL with `wsl --shutdown` and then started it again temporarily resolved the problem, but opening a `tmux` session would break it again. I tried the usual Windows shenanigans: check for updates, restart, etc. Nothing worked.

I finally found a hacky solution in [a GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/oleksis/871e185ff85b67e77565a214b163b0f0/#diagnosing-) written by [oleksis](https://github.com/oleksis) in [one of the GitHub issues of WSLg](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/1192). The important part for me was this:

> ## Init /tmp/.X11-unix is overwritten by mounts
>
> If you still don't see socket X0 follow these steps: [issuecomment-826039096](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/43#issuecomment-826039096)
