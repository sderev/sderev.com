By default, `np.var()` and `np.std()` calculate the **population** (biased) variance and standard deviation, whereas `statistics.variance()` and `statistics.stdev()` calculate the **sample** (unbiased) variance and standard deviation by default.

However, you can calculate the unbiased variance and standard deviation with NumPy by setting the `ddof` parameter to `1`.

```python
import numpy as np
import statistics

# Using NumPy
population_variance = np.var(data)
sample_variance = np.var(data, ddof=1)

# Using statistics
sample_variance = statistics.variance(data)
sample_standard_deviation = statistics.stdev(data)
```
