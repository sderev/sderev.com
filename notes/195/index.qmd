When you want Claude Code to drive Codex, or coordinate multiple agents (via OpenCode, Amp, or pi), don't over-engineer it with hooks or whatnot. Just use `tmux`.

## Use `tmux` as a Bridge

The trick is to treat `tmux` as a coordination layer. Have one agent create a new session, window, or pane that runs another agent CLI, then drive it with `tmux send-keys`. That gives you a simple and scriptable way to coordinate multiple agents.

### Example

```bash
# Start a second agent in its own tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s codex 'codex'

# Send instructions
tmux send-keys -t codex -l 'Read /tmp/instructions.md and follow it.'
tmux send-keys -t codex Enter

# Inspect output
tmux capture-pane -t codex -p -S -100
```

## Practical Caveats

You can also target panes using `<session>:<window>.<pane>` (for example `codex-review:1.2`).

Sending `Enter` can be flaky if you include newlines in the instructions string. I've had better results when I explicitly instruct the agent to press `Enter` after sending the instructions, and when the actual `tmux send-keys ... Enter` is its own command. Consider documenting this in your `AGENTS.md` or an agent skill.
