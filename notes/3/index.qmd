Use `xev` to find out which key you want to remap. Then create `~/.Xmodmap`.

Here's an example of to remap a key:

```bash
keycode xx = new_key
```

Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` to make it permanent:

```bash
xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
```

## Remap `<Caps_Lock>` to `<Escape>`

```bash
clear Lock
keycode 66 = Nosymbol Nosymbol Nosymbol 
keycode 66 = Escape
```

### When using GNOME

If you're using GNOME, you can remap the `<Caps_Lock>` key by following these steps:

1. install `gnome-tweaks`;
2. go to *Keyboard and Mouse*;
3. go to *Additional Layout Options*;
4. click on **Caps Lock behavior**;
5. click on **Make Caps Lock an additional Esc**.

### When using i3

If you're using i3, add this to the end of your i3 configuration file `~/.config/i3/config`:

```bash
exec --no-startup-id setxkbmap -option caps:escape
```

To take effect, you have to restart i3. You can do this by logging out and logging back.
