## Type Consistency

When working with integers, it's better to use integer values for comparisons. Mixing integers and floating-point numbers can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior due to floating-point precision limitations. Using `sys.maxsize` and `-sys.maxsize` ensures that we are working with integers throughout the code, maintaining type consistency.

## Readability

When reading the code, it's easier to understand the intent behind using `sys.maxsize` and `-sys.maxsize` for initializing the minimum and maximum values, as they represent the largest positive and negative integers supported by the system. In contrast, `float("inf")` and `float("-inf")` represent infinite values in the floating-point number system, which might be confusing for some readers, especially when working with integers.

## Performance

Although the performance difference is negligible in this case, using integer values for comparisons is generally faster than using floating-point numbers. This is because integer arithmetic is simpler and can be executed more quickly by the CPU.

## Summary 

Overall, using `sys.maxsize` and `-sys.maxsize` improves type consistency, readability, and performance when working with integer values in specific contexts.
