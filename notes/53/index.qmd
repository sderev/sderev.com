`su` and `su -` are Unix commands used to switch the user account in a terminal session. The key differences are:

### `su`

   * Switches to the specified user account without changing the environment variables or the current working directory.
   * **Maintains the environment variables of the user who executed the command.**
   * Defaults to the root user if no username is provided.
   * Syntax: `su [username]`

### `su -`

   * Switches to the specified user account and simulates **a full login by loading the target user's environment variables.**
   * Defaults to the root user if no username is provided.
   * Syntax: `su - [username]`

Both commands require the password of the target user (root, if no username is provided) to complete the switch.
