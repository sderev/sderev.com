In Pandoc Markdown, you can add a `title` and `alt` attribute, as well as a caption (using the `fig-alt` attribute key) to an image as follows:

```markdown
![Alt text](elephant.png "Title: An elephant"){fig-alt="A drawing of an elephant."}
```
**Caveat:** The whole string (viz. including "Title: ") will be used as the value of the `title` attribute.
