**First, set up the environment variables:**

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent)
```

**Then, add your private key to the agent and enter your passphrase:**

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Your passphrase is now cached for the rest of the shell session.

**Finally, you can list the fingerprints of all your keys currently represented by the agent:**

```bash
ssh-add -l
```
