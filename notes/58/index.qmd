## Standard Output (stdout)

To redirect stdout to a file, use the `>` operator:

```bash
command > output.txt
```

To append stdout to a file, use the `>>` operator:

```bash
command >> output.txt
```

## Standard Error (stderr)

To redirect stderr to a file, use the `2>` operator:

```bash
command 2> errors.txt
```

## Redirecting stdout and stderr Separately

To redirect stdout and stderr to separate files:

```bash
command > output.txt 2> errors.txt
```

## Redirecting stdout and stderr to the Same File

To redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file:

```bash
command > output_and_errors.txt 2>&1
```

Here, `2>&1` means "redirect stderr (2) to the same location as stdout (1)".

Or even simpler, as it does the same thing:

```bash
command &> output_and_errors.txt
```
