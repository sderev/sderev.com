Whether you know you'll soon reach your 5h usage limit with Claude Code or Codex, or you just reached it, you'll be happy to learn how to use the `at` command, that enables you to schedule a one-shot job. Combined with `tmux`, you'll be able to auto-resume your coding AI agent.

## Wakey Wakey

```bash
echo "
tmux has-session -t absolute-necessity 2>/dev/null || exit 0
tmux send-keys -t absolute-necessity:1.1 Enter
sleep 5
tmux send-keys -t absolute-necessity:1.1 -l 'Resume'
sleep 5
tmux send-keys -t absolute-necessity:1.1 Enter
" | at 14:00
```

## Caveat

This relies on `atd` running, and at schedules in your local timezone.

## Useful helpers

```bash
atq        # list queued jobs
atrm <id>  # remove a job
at -c <id>  # cat job contents
```
