Here's a helpful reminder for those who might be concerned about using `OrderedDict` for compatibility reasons:

> You probably don't need OrderedDict.

> If your code has f-strings in it, you can rely on dictionaries maintaining their order. ðŸ“‘
>
> Dictionaries are ordered as of Python 3.6. Using an f-string before Python 3.6 results in syntax errors.

This behavior was implemented in CPython 3.6, and guaranteed in Python 3.7 (source: <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#new-dict-implementation>).

So f-strings may not always be helpful to determine if dictionaries are ordered.

But I'm with him on this nonetheless. I don't want to split hairs. It's a good rule to follow.
