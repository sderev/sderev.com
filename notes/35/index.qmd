### Your start with something like this

```markdown
one
two
three
```

### Use the `VISUAL BLOCK` mode and `Shift-i` to add numbers

```markdown
0. one
0. two
0. three
```

### Select in `VISUAL LINE` mode, then you can increment by 1 with `Ctrl-a`

```markdown
1. one
1. two
1. three
```
*Note that this would already be correctly rendered when converted from Markdown to HTML.*

### Or you can press `g Ctrl-a` to order the lines in the text file

```markdown
1. one
2. two
3. three
```

### Instead of `Ctrl-a`, you can decrement by pressing `Ctrl-x`.

```markdown
# before 
1. one
2. two
3. three

# after
0. one
0. two
0. three

```
