When using `zsh` or `bash` with `vi` mode enabled, you can efficiently navigate and search through your command history.

## Entering Command Mode

Ensure you're in command mode (normal mode) by pressing `ESC`.

## Searching in History

To **search backward** through previous commands:

* Press `/` followed by your search term.
* Press `Enter`.

## Navigating Search Results and History

After initiating a search, navigate through matches and history using:

* `n` - for the **next** match in the direction of your initial search.
* `N` - for the **previous** match, opposite to your initial search.
* `j` - to move to the **next** command in history (downwards).
* `k` - to move to the **previous** command in history (upwards).

## Configuring `zsh` for Shared History (useful with tmux)

To ensure that all `zsh` sessions (e.g., across different `tmux` panes or windows) share the same command history, add the following option to your `zshrc`:

```sh
# Enables sharing of command history between different zsh sessions.
setopt share_history
```
