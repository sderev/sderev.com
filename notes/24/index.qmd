```bash
ssh-copy-id user@server
```

**Use the `-i` flag to specify a particular key**

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@server
```

**From the documentation:**

> If the filename does not end in *.pub* this is added.

So, you don't copy your private key, it's alright. But add it nonetheless if you want to feel extra secured.

**To disable root ssh login, add this to `/etc/sshd_config`:**

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

**To force ssh key login only, add this to `/etc/sshd_config`:**

```bash
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
```

**Finally, restart ssh:**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
