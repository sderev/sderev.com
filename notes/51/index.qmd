Put your cursor on the path and press `gf`.

To quickly open the last file that was edited in Vim, you can use the `:e#` command. This is useful when you want to switch back to the file you were previously editing without having to retype its full path.

Note that the `:e#` command only re-opens the last buffer that was edited in the current window.

To navigate through buffers, you cal also use `:bn` or `:bnext`, and `:bp` or `:bprev`.
