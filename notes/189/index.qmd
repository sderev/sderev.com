I've been using File Pilot for a few months now, and I recommend every Windows user to try it out.

Below is my AutoHotkey `Win + e` remap to get rid of the default File Explorer:

```ahk
#e:: ; Remap `Win + e` to File Pilot
    WinGet, fpilot_id, ID, ahk_exe FPilot.exe
    
    if (fpilot_id) { ; File Pilot exists -> toggle behavior
        WinGet, active_id, ID, A
        if (active_id = fpilot_id) {
            WinMinimize, ahk_id %fpilot_id%
        } else {
            WinActivate, ahk_id %fpilot_id%
        }
    } else { ; File Pilot is not running -> launch it
        Run, "<path_to_your_File_Pilot_exe>"
    }
return
```

Don't forget to replace `<path_to_your_File_Pilot_exe>` with your actual path.

If you don't already have an AutoHotkey script running from startup, just create a `.ahk` file with the code above and place it in your startup folder -- accessed by pressing `Win + r` and typing `shell:startup`.
