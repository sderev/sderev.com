```python
print("ß".casefold())
>>> ss
```

### From the Python documentation

> Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for caseless matching.
> 
> Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to "ss". Since it is already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'ß'; casefold() converts it to "ss".

It is useful for search and sorting case-insensitive strings.
