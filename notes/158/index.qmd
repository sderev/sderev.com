I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to generate my website, which includes my notes.

For the listing of [my notes](https://sderev.com/notes), I wanted a way to feature certain notes. To do that, I created a custom key-value pair in the YAML header of the notes that I named `spotlight` so that it will be invisible in the listing, and I set the value to a star emoji `⭐`:

```yaml
---
title: "The `hosts` File as a Self-Care Hack to Block Distractions"
subtitle: "Note#156"
id: "156"
date: 2024-06-01
date-modified: ""
date-format: iso
categories: [notes]
spotlight: "⭐"
---
```

Then, in the YAML header of the listing page, I set the `fields` key to include the custom key-value pair:

```yaml
---
title: "Notes"
listing:
    page-size: 1000
    sort: 
      - "date desc"
      - "subtitle desc"
    sort-ui: [subtitle, reading-time]
    type: table
    filter-ui: true
    categories: false
    fields: [subtitle, title, spotlight, date]
    date-format: iso
---
```

See how it renders:
