I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to generate my website, which includes my notes.

For the listing of [my notes](https://sderev.com/notes), I wanted a way to feature certain notes. To do that, I created a custom key-value pair in the YAML header of the note that I named `spotlight`, and I set the value to a star emoji `⭐`:

```yaml
---
title: "The `hosts` File as a Self-Care Hack to Block Distractions"
subtitle: "Note#156"
id: "156"
date: 2024-06-01
date-modified: ""
date-format: iso
categories: [notes]
spotlight: "⭐"
---
```

Then, in the YAML header of the listing page, I set the `fields` key to include the custom key-value pair, and I hide it with a non-breaking space character:

```yaml
title: "Notes"
listing:
    ...
    fields: [id, title, spotlight, date]
    field-display-names:
        spotlight: "&nbsp;"
```

See how it renders:
