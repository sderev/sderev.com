It can be slow, though... It must be related to the archive servers, however, since it doesn't fetch install packages from Microsoft. Also, it's the usual install process afterwards; and some softwares take a really long time to install.

I don't know how it compares with Chocolatey. I've never used it.

### See which packages Windows can upgrade on its own:

```bash
winget upgrade
```

### Upgrade everything:

```bash
winget upgrade --all
```

You might want to add the flag `--include-unknown` to handle packages for which Windows can't determine the latest version.

```bash
winget upgrade --all --include-unknown
```

### Upgrade a specific package:

```powershell
winget upgrade package_name
```
