## Problem

Navigating hierarchical or nested context menus in UIs can be a challenging task. Users often encounter issues where the submenu disappears if the cursor slightly deviates from the intended path, leading to a frustrating user experience.

## Solution: The "Safe Triangle"

The "Safe Triangle" is a UI design pattern that effectively addresses this issue. It enhances the usability of hierarchical or nested context menus by creating an SVG triangle that serves as a "safe zone" around the submenu. Cursor tracking is implemented to ensure that the submenu remains open as long as the cursor is within this triangular area.
