There is no configuration needed other than authenticating another account with `gh auth login`. After that, the new account will be added to `~/.config/gh/hosts.yaml`.

You can see which accounts are associated with your configuration by running `gh auth status`. You'll also see which account is currently active.

As of now, you have to manually switch the active account, which you can do with `gh auth switch`.
