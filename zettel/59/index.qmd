## `which`

* External command, typically found at `/usr/bin/which`
* Searches for executables in directories listed in `PATH`
* Returns the absolute path of the first match found in `PATH`
* Returns an error message if the command is not found
* Not POSIX-compliant: behavior might vary across Unix-like systems
* Less reliable for use in shell scripts

## `command -v`

* Shell built-in command (e.g., bash, zsh)
* Searches for executables, shell built-ins, shell functions, and aliases
* Returns the absolute path if the command is an executable
* Returns the command definition if it's a shell built-in, function, or alias
* Returns nothing if the command is not found
* POSIX-compliant: more consistent behavior across Unix-like systems
* More reliable for use in shell scripts
