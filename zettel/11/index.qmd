> **Casting: Telling the compiler that an object is really something else without changing it (though some data loss may be incurred).**
>
> ```Cs
> object obj_s= "12345";
> string str_i = (string) obj; // "12345" as string, explicit
>
> int small = 12345;
> long big = 0;
> big = small; // 12345 as long, implicit
> ```
>
> **Parsing: Telling the program to interpret (on runtime) a string.**
>
> ```Cs
> string int_s = "12345";
> int i = int.Parse(int_s); // 12345 as int
> ```
>
> **Converting: Telling the program to use built in methods to try to change type for what may be not simply interchangeable.**
>
> ```Cs
> double dub = 123.45;
> int i = System.Convert.ToInt32(dub); // 123 as int
> ```
