I typically rely on `vi` mode for editing commands, but `!!` could be useful for those who don't, as it recalls the last command. Useful for adding a forgotten `sudo` or making quick adjustments.

```bash
$ apt update  # Oops, forgot sudo
$ sudo !!
```

Note that can use `!b` to recall the most recent command starting with `b`. It works with any letter.
