`CDPATH` is an environment variable in Unix-like shells such as Bash and Zsh that allows for quick directory navigation. It holds a list of directories that the `cd` command will search when you attempt to change directories.

## Setting Up `CDPATH`

To set up `CDPATH`, add the following `export` statement to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export CDPATH=/path/to/projects:/another/path/to/projects
```

Apply the changes by either sourcing your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) or launching a new shell session with commands like `exec -l zsh`.

## Usage Example

Assume `CDPATH` is set as follows:

```bash
export CDPATH=/home/user/projects:/usr/local
```

* `cd my_app`: Takes you to `/home/user/projects/my_app`, regardless of your current location, if the directory exists.
* `cd etc`: Takes you to `/usr/local/etc` if it exists.
