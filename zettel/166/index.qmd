1. **Despondency**: This refers to a state of low spirits caused by loss of hope or courage. It implies a deep discouragement and loss of confidence in the future.

2. **Dejection**: This describes a sad and depressed state, often caused by disappointment. It's typically less severe and more temporary than despondency.

3. **Gloom**: This term can refer to both a physical darkness and a mental state of melancholy or pessimism. As an emotional state, it's often less intense than despondency but more pervasive than dejection.

## Using these words in writing:

1. Use "despondency" when describing a character who has lost all hope, perhaps after a series of failures or setbacks.
    * **Example**: "After months of fruitless job searching, John sank into despondency."

2. "Dejection" is appropriate for temporary states of sadness or disappointment.
    * **Example**: "Sarah's dejection was evident as she left the audition, convinced she hadn't performed well."

3. "Gloom" works well to set a somber mood or atmosphere, or to describe a general state of pessimism.
    * **Example**: "The constant rain cast a gloom over the entire town."
