You probably know you can access the clipboard on Windows by pressing `Win + V`. This opens up a pane with various tabs, including one for pasting emojis. However, a direct way to access the emoji pane (that I just discovered!) is by pressing `Win + .` (period key).

For AZERTY keyboards, use `Win + ;` (semicolon key) instead.
