> If you want non-interactive shell (as default) but expansion of bash aliases, put your alias definitions in a file, e.g. `.bash_aliases` and explicitly enable alias expansion in this file:

> shopt -s expand_aliases  
> alias la='ls -la'

> let $BASH_ENV = "~/.bash_aliases"

## My opinion

Using scripts should be the preferred method though, as they are reliable and shareable. It's generally a good idea to follow the principles of the Unix philosophy.
