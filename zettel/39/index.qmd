Although my tenacious habit of searching everything on the web when I can't remember something has been helpful so far, I recognize the need to focus more on creating content for my Zettelkasten.

When I forget something, I tend not to write a Zettel for it, either because I consider it too trivial to merit one or because I assume I could easily find the information again. However, the Zettelkasten is not just an archive of notes but also a tool to generate new knowledge. Taking the time to write a note, even for seemingly mundane information, like my [Zettel#38](/zettel/38) about switching the case of characters in Vim, can be an effective method to retain the information in my long-term memory.

This is what I wrote in my draft article, "*How to learn*", really. It's crucial to practice what you preach; and I realize that I need to apply this approach more often myself.
