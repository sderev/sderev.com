To make Black ignore a specific portion of your code, you can use the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` comments.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Add `# fmt: off` before the section you want Black to ignore.
2. Write your code (the portion you don't want Black to format).
3. Add `# fmt: on` after the section you want Black to ignore.

**Example:**

```python
import numpy as np

# fmt: off
matrix = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
])
# fmt: on

def some_function():
    pass
```

In this example, the matrix array will not be formatted by Black, while the rest of the code will follow Black's formatting rules.
