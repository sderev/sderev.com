You can set an environment variable `OLLAMA_MODELS` according to [the documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#where-are-models-stored). However, it seems like it doesn't always work for unknown reasons.

Instead, you can create a symbolic link to a custom model directory:

```bash
sudo ln -s /path/to/custom/ollama/model_dir/ /usr/share/ollama/.ollama
```
