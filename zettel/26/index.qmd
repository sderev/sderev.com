`shred` overwrites a target by generating random sequences of 0 and 1.

### This command will follow 5 passes in the background

```bash
shred -fz -n 5 --random-source=/dev/urandom /dev/sda &
```

This will take a long, long time. However, I read that one pass is sufficient (Wright, Kleiman, & Sundhar, 2008), so **maybe don't do multiple passes** after all.
