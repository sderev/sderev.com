I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to generate my website, which includes my Zettelkasten.

For the listing of [my Zettelkasten](https://sderev.com/zettel), I wanted a way to feature certain Zettel. To do that, I created a custom key-value pair in the YAML header of the Zettel that I named `"&nbsp;"` so that it will be invisible in the listing, and I set the value to a star emoji `⭐`:

```yaml
---
title: "The `hosts` File as a Self-Care Hack to Block Distractions"
subtitle: "Zettel#156"
id: "156"
date: 2024-06-01
date-modified: ""
date-format: iso
categories: [zettelkasten]
"&nbsp;": "⭐"
---
```

Then, in the YAML header of the listing page, I set the `fields` key to include the custom key-value pair:

```yaml
---
title: "Zettelkasten"
listing:
    page-size: 1000
    sort: 
      - "date desc"
      - "subtitle desc"
    sort-ui: [subtitle, reading-time]
    type: table
    filter-ui: true
    categories: false
    fields: [subtitle, title, "&nbsp;", date]
    date-format: iso
---
```

See how it renders:
