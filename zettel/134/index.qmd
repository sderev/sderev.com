These instructions are adapted for my own customized meta key, set to `ctrl-q`. You will obviously need to adapt it to your own meta key if different.

## Detach the Pane

* Press `ctrl-q !` to detach the pane you want to move.
* This will create a new window containing only the pane you want to move.

## Navigate to Target Window

* Switch to the window where you want to move the pane.
* Use `ctrl-q 1` to switch to window 1, for example.

## Join the Pane

* Press `ctrl-q :` and then type `join-pane -s [source-window]`.
* Replace `[source-window]` with the ID or name of the window created in the previous step.
* If needed, list all windows with `ctrl-q s` to find this ID.
