Over the years, the algorithm has been refined and is commonly used in applications requiring sophisticated image resizing."

    "section": "The Algorithm",
    "text": "The Algorithm\n\nGreyscale Conversion\nThe algorithm starts by converting the original color image into greyscale. The greyscale value v of a pixel is calculated using the formula v = round(.299*r + .587*g + .114*b), where r, g, and b represent the red, green, and blue values of the pixel respectively.\n\n\nEnergy Map Calculation\nAn ‘energy map’ of the greyscale image is computed. This map uses an edge detection function to represent the “energy” or significance of each pixel.\n\n\nCumulative Energy Map Computation\nThe algorithm computes a cumulative energy map after creating the energy map. The cumulative energy map is a matrix of the same dimensions as the image where the value at each pixel is not just the energy of that pixel, but the total energy of the lowest-energy path from the top of the image to that pixel.\nTo calculate this, the algorithm starts with the top row of the image, where the cumulative energy is the same as the original energy from the energy map. For each subsequent row, the algorithm finds the cumulative energy for each pixel by adding its own energy value (from the energy map) to the minimum cumulative energy of the pixels directly above it in the previous row. The pixels considered are directly above, or one pixel to the right or to the left of the current pixel in the row above. This process is repeated for each pixel and for each row, down to the bottom of the image.\n\n\nMinimum-Energy Seam Identification\nThe process of identifying the minimum-energy seam begins once the cumulative energy map is complete. This seam is a connected path of pixels from the top to the bottom of the image that has the lowest total energy.\nTo identify this seam, the algorithm starts at the bottom row of the cumulative energy map and locates the pixel with the smallest cumulative energy. This pixel is the start of the minimum-energy seam. The algorithm then traces the seam back up to the top of the image. At each step, the algorithm moves to the pixel in the row above that has the smallest cumulative energy and is adjacent to the current pixel. The adjacent pixels considered are directly above, or one pixel to the right or to the left of the current pixel.\nThis process creates a path from the bottom of the image to the top, representing the seam of least cumulative energy. This seam is then used in the final step of the algorithm: seam removal.\n\n\nSeam Removal\nThe identified seam is then removed from the original color image, effectively reducing the image’s width by one pixel. This process is repeated until the image is resized to the desired size."

It selectively removes less important portions of the image, ensuring that the core visual content remains intact, a significant improvement over traditional resizing methods.\n\n\nDisadvantage\nThe algorithm might struggle with images that have a lot of high-energy content, or when important details are evenly distributed across the image. In such cases, important content might be removed, leading to a loss in image quality."

    "text": "What is uv\nuv should replace pip, pip-tools, and even virtualenv.\n\nA drop-in compatible API\nThis initial release centers on what we refer to as uv’s pip API. It’ll be familiar to those that have used pip and pip-tools in the past:\nInstead of pip install, run uv pip install to install Python dependencies from the command line, a requirements file, or a pyproject.toml.\nInstead of pip-compile, run uv pip compile to generate a locked requirements.txt.\nInstead of pip-sync, run uv pip sync to sync a virtual environment with a locked requirements.txt.\n\n\nAdvanced Resolution Strategies\n\n\nuv supports alternate resolution strategies. By default, uv follows the standard Python dependency resolution strategy of preferring the latest compatible version of each package. But by passing --resolution=lowest, library authors can test their packages against the lowest-compatible version of their dependencies.\nuv allows for resolutions against arbitrary target Python versions. While pip and pip-tools always resolve against the currently-installed Python version (generating, e.g., a Python 3.12-compatible resolution when running under Python 3.12), uv accepts a --python-version parameter, enabling you to generate, e.g., Python 3.7-compatible resolutions even when running under newer versions.\nuv allows for dependency “overrides”. uv takes pip’s “constraints” concepts a step further via overrides (-o overrides.txt), which allow the user to guide the resolver by overriding the declared dependencies of a package. Overrides give the user an escape hatch for working around erroneous upper bounds and other incorrectly-declared dependencies."

This is a common convention, especially when the virtual environment is located within the project folder.\nenv: Another short and clear name that indicates it’s a virtual environment.\nmyenv: Replace my with a more descriptive name related to the project or purpose of the environment.\nprojectname_env: Replace projectname with the name of the project. This helps to easily identify the virtual environment associated with a specific project.\n\nKeep in mind that it’s a good practice to choose a name that clearly indicates the purpose or project it’s associated with.

This behavior can optimize the speed of these operations for specific use cases.\nThe in operator only needs to return a boolean value indicating presence or absence, while the find() method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.\nFor built-in types like sets and dictionaries, Python’s in operator can use a hash-based lookup, which can be faster than a linear search for certain cases.\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\nThe in operator is designed specifically to check for the presence of an element in a sequence, while the find() method is designed to search for a substring and return its index.\nSince the in operator only needs to return a boolean value, its implementation is focused on presence checking, while find() also provides the index of the found substring."

    "text": "Source: https://py.mit.edu/spring24/readings/graph_search#_summary_of_bfs_vs_dfs\n\nBFS\n\nTo implement a breadth-first search, we add and remove elements from opposite sides of the agenda. This approach is known as “first-in, first-out” (commonly written/pronounced as “FIFO”) since the element we remove is always the one that was added first.\nBFS is guaranteed to return a shortest path to a goal vertex if such a path exists, regardless of the structure of our graph. Because we consider all paths of length n before considering any paths of length n + 1, we know that, when we first encounter a state that satisfies our goal condition, the path we’re considering must be optimal (in the sense that there is no shorter path to the goal).\nBFS can run forever if it is being applied to an infinite graph with no solution, but it will always terminate in a finite graph or in an infinite graph where a solution exists.\n\nDFS\n\nTo implement a depth-first search, we add and remove elements from the same side of the agenda. This approach is known as “last-in, first-out” (commonly written/pronounced as “LIFO”) since the element we remove is always the last one that was added.\nDFS is guaranteed to find a path to the goal (but not necessarily an optimal one) if such a path exists and if the graph is finite.\nDFS may run forever on an infinite graph, even if a solution exists.\n\nDFS = Bad?\nIn all of the examples we have seen so far, DFS gives us a pretty gnarly path in the end, something that is kind of ugly and far from optimal. And, in the section above, we’ve stated that the guarantees that DFS offers us are weaker than those that BFS offers us. So, at this point, you may be thinking: why did we even bother introducing DFS? When would you ever want to use it?\nThe answer is a little bit nuanced, but the short version is that DFS tends to use less memory than BFS. If we consider a graph with a “branching factor” of b (i.e., every state is connected to b other states), then there will be around b^n paths of length n. This means that there will be around b^elements in the agenda when we’re considering the last path of length n − 1. By contrast, the agenda for a DFS will have around b × n elements in the agenda when considering a path of length n; and, as b and n increase, b × n is substantially smaller than b^n. This is especially useful in cases where we don’t care about finding the optimal path to a state (sometimes any path will do, or sometimes we’re just looking for a particular state and don’t care about the path at all); and, in those cases, DFS can sometimes be the right choice."

    "text": "Interesting (but Useless) Trick: Swapping Variables\nThe XOR swap trick is more of a neat parlor trick than anything else. In modern high-level languages and with today’s compiler optimizations, there’s generally no reason to use XOR swap instead of traditional swapping with a temporary variable (or with the pythonic a, b = b, a). However, it’s a good demonstration of how XOR works and how you can take advantage of its unique properties.\nConventionally, if we wanted to swap the values of two variables, we would need a temporary variable to hold the value of one variable during the operation. For example:\ndef swap(a, b):\n    temp = a\n    a = b\n    b = temp\n    return a, b\nHowever, the XOR operator allows us to swap values without the need for a temporary variable.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nLet a and b be the two numbers to be swapped.\nExecute a = a XOR b.\nExecute b = a XOR b (since a is now a XOR b, this is equivalent to b = (a XOR b) XOR b, which simplifies to b = a according to the inverse property).\nFinally, execute a = a XOR b (at this stage b is already a, so this is equivalent to a = (a XOR b) XOR a, which simplifies to a = b).\n\ndef swap_without_temp(a, b):\n    a = a ^ b\n    b = a ^ b\n    a = a ^ b\n    return a, b"

    "section": "Vim Magic Regex Mode",
    "text": "Vim Magic Regex Mode\nVim’s regular expressions offer two primary modes: magic and nomagic. These modes define how special characters, those with meanings beyond their literal representation, are treated.\nThe magic mode aligns Vim’s regular expressions more closely with the behavior of regular expressions in other languages and tools, considering characters such as . , * , ^ , and $ as special. This mode is activated by initiating the regular expression with \\v.\nIn contrast, nomagic mode necessitates escaping more characters with a backslash, as it considers fewer characters special. This mode can be activated by initiating the regular expression with \\V.\nImportantly, Vim operates in a somewhat magic mode by default, a middle ground between the two extremes. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to explicitly specify the mode (\\v for very magic and \\V for very nomagic).\n\nExamples of Magic, Somewhat Magic, and Nomagic Modes\nThe following examples demonstrate the impact of magic, somewhat magic (default), and nomagic modes on Vim regular expressions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nMagic Mode Example (\\v)\nDefault (Somewhat Magic) Mode Example\nNomagic Mode Example (\\V)\n\n\n\n\nMatch “test” exactly\n\\vtest\ntest\n\\Vtest\n\n\nMatch “test” at the start of line\n\\v^test\n^test\n\\V\\^test\n\n\nMatch “test” at the end of line\n\\vtest$\ntest$\n\\Vtest\\$\n\n\nMatch “test” as a whole word\n\\v&lt;test&gt;\n\\&lt;test\\&gt;\n\\V\\&lt;test\\&gt;\n\n\nMatch one or more “a”s\n\\va+\na\\+\n\\Va\\+\n\n\nMatch zero or more “a”s\n\\va*\na*\n\\Va\\*\n\n\nMatch “a” zero or one times\n\\va?\na\\?\n\\Va\\?\n\n\nNon-greedy match for one or more “a”s\n\\va{-1,}\na\\{-1,\\}\n\\Va\\{-1,\\}\n\n\nNon-greedy match for zero or more “a”s\n\\va{-}\na\\{-\\}\n\\Va\\{-\\}\n\n\nMatch “a” followed by “b” or “c”\n\\v(a\\|b)\n\\(\\a\\|b\\)\n\\V\\(a\\\\|b\\)\n\n\n\nIn magic mode, Vim’s regex behaves more like other languages’ regular expressions, so you often need fewer backslashes. The default somewhat magic mode treats fewer characters as special, so more backslashes are required compared to magic mode. nomagic mode treats even fewer characters as special, so even more backslashes are typically required.\n\n\nVim’s Built-in Documentation\nFor more information about the magic mode in Vim’s regular expressions, refer to the built-in documentation by typing:\n:help /\\v"

In this file, the ttimeoutlen option is set to 100 ms, which is why I didn’t encounter any delay when testing without a .vimrc file.\n\nAdd this to your .vimrc file\nset ttimeoutlen=100"

Sometimes pathlib provides a more efficient way to perform a certain operation than os.path does, or vice versa.\nMinimize the creation of unnecessary Path objects. If you need to manipulate paths in a performance-critical loop, consider using os.path functions or caching Path objects where possible to avoid creating new objects repeatedly.\nProfile your code to identify performance bottlenecks. If you find that pathlib is causing a significant slowdown in your code, you can consider switching to os.path for those specific operations."

A common misunderstanding is to associate the type declarations with strong typing. This is despite the fact that compilers in languages like Go or Rust can infer types, thus not requiring explicity declarations by the programmer, which contradicts the initial association. And optional type annotations are often mistakenly linked with weak typing. Moreover, type declarations are sometimes incorrectly associated with static typing, and type annotations with dynamic typing.\nIt goes beyond that, but static typing involves type checking at compile-time, whereas dynamic typing involves type checking at runtime.\nRegarding the spectrum of strong and weak typing, I tend to define it based on how rigidly a language adheres to type constraints during operations."

    "text": "Abstract\nWe evaluated 3 systems (ELIZA, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in a randomized, controlled, and preregistered Turing test. Human participants had a 5 minute conversation with either a human or an AI, and judged whether or not they thought their interlocutor was human. GPT-4 was judged to be a human 54% of the time, outperforming ELIZA (22%) but lagging behind actual humans (67%). The results provide the first robust empirical demonstration that any artificial system passes an interactive 2-player Turing test. The results have implications for debates around machine intelligence and, more urgently, suggest that deception by current AI systems may go undetected. Analysis of participants’ strategies and reasoning suggests that stylistic and socio-emotional factors play a larger role in passing the Turing test than traditional notions of intelligence."

Participants engaged in 5-minute conversations and identified their interlocutors as either human or AI.\n\n\nResults\n\nGPT-4 was identified as human 54% of the time.\nELIZA was identified as human 22% of the time.\nActual humans were correctly identified 67% of the time.\n\n\n\nImplications\nThese findings highlight GPT-4’s advanced conversational abilities, though it still lags behind actual humans. The study suggests that stylistic and socio-emotional factors are crucial in passing the Turing test.\nThe figure below shows all the strategies used by participants to identify the AI:\n\n\n\nPersonal Notes\n\nI find the method used in the study somewhat unusual and have doubts about the results. It’s relatively easy to distinguish an AI from a human by applying jailbreak techniques or focusing on knowledge areas.\nA language model typically possesses extensive knowledge across various fields, allowing it to respond in multiple languages or provide code, bypassing prompt restrictions easily.\nQuerying the model on diverse subjects can reveal its vast knowledge base, which an average human wouldn’t have.\nI have trouble believing these results. The percentages could still be explained by random guessing.\nIf these findings are more robust than I think, it indicates a lack of education and practical use of these language models in the general population.\nIt always has been easy to bamboozle with “intelligence” stuff: the mechanical turk, Clever Hans, etc."

    "section": "Advantages",
    "text": "Advantages\n\nReadability\nPartial functions can improve the readability of your code, especially when dealing with higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce. By creating a partially-applied function, you can give it a meaningful name that makes the intent of your code clearer to readers. This can be particularly helpful when the function’s arguments are not immediately obvious or when the function is used multiple times with the same fixed arguments.\n\n\nCode reusability\nCreating partial functions allows you to reuse the same base function with different fixed arguments, which can lead to more modular and maintainable code. Instead of writing separate functions for each specialized case, you can have one general function and create partial functions for the specific cases. This can help prevent code duplication and make it easier to update or extend the base function.\n\n\nEasier refactoring\nIn some cases, the original function may be part of a library or third-party code that you don’t have control over. By using partial functions, you can adapt the original function to your specific needs without modifying the original code. This can make it easier to refactor your code or switch to a different library or implementation in the future.\n\n\nCustomizing callbacks\nWhen working with libraries or frameworks that expect you to provide a callback function, sometimes you need to supply additional arguments to the callback that aren’t provided by the library or framework itself. Partial functions allow you to preconfigure the callback with the necessary arguments while still satisfying the expected function signature.\n\n\nExample\nHere’s an example to illustrate how using partial functions can improve readability:\nimport functools\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\n# Without using partial functions\ndoubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: multiply(2, x), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))\n\n# With partial functions\ndouble = functools.partial(multiply, 2)\ndoubled_numbers = list(map(double, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))\n\n# The output is the same: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nIn this example, we have a multiply function that takes two arguments. Without using partial functions, we use a lambda expression to create an anonymous function that calls multiply with the first argument fixed as 2. This can be less readable, especially for more complex functions or when multiple arguments need to be fixed.\nBy using a partial function, we can create a new function called double that has a meaningful name and fixes the first argument of multiply to 2. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand."

The log format is specified using a formatter, which includes the timestamp, log level, and log message. The logger.error() method is used to write the error message to the log file.\nBy logging error messages to a file, you can easily track and analyze them, helping to identify and troubleshoot issues more effectively."

For example: cat file.txt | clip.exe.\nInterestingly, I discovered that xclip can function within WSL without the need for an external X server. This is likely due to improvements in WSLg, which provides better support for graphical applications and features such as the clipboard.\nIt also worked for a VM running with Hyper-V, to which I connected through SSH with X11 forwardig (ssh -X)."

From my own .vimrc:\n\" Let's save undo info!\nif !isdirectory($HOME.\"/.vim\")\n    call mkdir($HOME.\"/.vim\", \"\", 0770)\nendif\nif !isdirectory($HOME.\"/.vim/undo-dir\")\n    call mkdir($HOME.\"/.vim/undo-dir\", \"\", 0700)\nendif\nset undodir=~/.vim/undo-dir\nset undofile\nI prefer not to clutter random directories with undo files. So I set the undodir option, which puts all of them in one undo directory. That leaves one problem—I’m lazy, and don’t feel like creating that directory on all my machines (I use a version control system to sync my .vimrc across a bunch of machines). Thankfully, it’s easy enough to have Vim check for and create the directories if they don’t exist.\nNote also the 0700 mode on the undo directory (that’s full permissions for the owner, no permissions for anyone else). Which files I’ve edited, when, etc. should stay private. And since this is a directory only I can access, I don’t have to worry about someone else putting a symlink in there, or their own undo file, or whatever as you’d have to worry about using a system temporary directory.\nFinally, not being a system temporary directory, it’s not subject to the system tempfile cleanup policy. Often, that’s fairly short—a week or so. But to keep it from growing forever, I put the following in my crontab:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n 43 00 *   *   3     find /home/anthony/.vim/undo-dir -type f -mtime +90 -delete\nSo after 90 days of not being modified, they’re deleted. (Honestly, they’re not really that big, and you could easily leave them forever with how cheap disk is. But consider also your own privacy if your machine is ever compromised.)\n\nhttps://vi.stackexchange.com/a/53"

C’est à une toute autre échelle, mais n’importe quel artiste apprend par le pastiche sans jamais qu’il ne soit question de droits d’auteurs. Le véritable enjeu se trouve dans l’accès aux données : les grosses entreprises ont les moyens de récolter des données colossales pour construire leurs modèles ; mais sans les mettre à la disposition de tout un chacun, elles créent un problème de démocratie majeur.\nCertains détracteurs et “lanceurs d’alertes” utilisent parfois cette qualification de prompt engineer pour nommer avec sarcasme les personnes qui se servent de ces IA pour créer des images, et ainsi retirer toute la créativité de leur agentivité. Pour moi, il est plutôt clair que c’est la machine qui est le réel “artiste”, tandis que les prompt engineers ont un rôle de directeur artistique – à la façon d’un réalisateur de cinéma. Ici, Jeremy Howard parle du prompt engineering comme d’un ensemble de compétences, sans aucun mépris, que tout le monde va devoir développer par la force des choses.

This makes the set-based approach more efficient than the word by word check when querying multiple words against the file.\n\nReminder\nNote that while caching the set of words in memory can improve performance for small to medium-sized files, it may not be optimal for very large files, since reading the entire file into memory can consume a lot of resources. Therefore, it’s important to consider the size of the files that will be processed by the word_exists() function, and adjust the caching strategy accordingly.\n\n\nThe Bloom Filter\nA Bloom filter may be a good alternative to the set-based approach for checking the existence of elements in very large files or sets. By using hashing and a bit array, a Bloom filter can achieve fast query times and a small memory footprint, while also controlling the probability of false positives. However, it may not be suitable for applications that require high precision.\n\nBloom filter - Wikipedia"

    "section": "",
    "text": "To design an effective interface, you must balance several criteria. In general, you should try to develop interfaces that are:\n\nUnified. A single interface should define a consistent abstraction with a clear unifying theme. If a function does not fit within that theme, it should be defined in a separate interface.\nSimple. To the extent that the underlying implementation is itself complex, the interface must hide as much of that complexity from the client as possible.\nSufficient. When clients use an abstraction, the interface must provide sufficient functionality to meet their needs. If some critical operation is missing from an interface, clients may decide to abandon it and develop their own, more powerful abstraction. As important as simplicity is, the designer must avoid simplifying an interface to the point that it becomes useless.\nGeneral. A well-designed interface should be flexible enough to meet the needs of many different clients. An interface that performs a narrowly defined set of operations for one client is not as useful as one that can be used in many different situations.\nStable. The functions defined in an interface should continue to have precisely the same structure and effect, even if their underlying implementation changes. Making changes in the behavior of an interface forces clients to change their programs, which compromises the value of the interface.\n\n\nQuoted from Programming Abstractions in C++, (Chapter 2.7)."

    "text": "When to Fine-Tune\n\nIf you have a prompt that resembles a programming language with numerous conditional statements, it’s an indication that fine-tuning might be beneficial.\nAdditionally, because of the diverse types of examples and various edge cases, it is challenging to cover all possibilities with just a few examples. However, there are strategies to enhance these few-shot examples. For instance, you could use RAG and maintain a database of different examples, making the few-shot examples dynamic. This approach can sometimes be effective.\nThese are some indicators to consider when evaluating the problem itself.\nHamel Husain\n\n\nData Privacy\nFine-tuning allows you to use private data to customize a model without exposing sensitive information to third-party services.\n\n\nQuality vs Latency Trade-off\nWhile using and/or generating fewer tokens can reduce latency, a fine-tuned model may also become so specialized that it limits its ability to perform other tasks.\n\n\nExtremely Narrow Problem\nFor very specialized tasks, general models may not perform adequately. Fine-tuning can help to address these issues.\n\n\nWhen Prompt Engineering Becomes Impractical\nFor complex tasks that require detailed prompts with many conditions, prompt engineering can become inefficient. In such cases, fine-tuning can be an effective solution."

Is the task something a small model can do? Does it require more “reasoning”?\n\nA larger model will cost more and be harder to host. I only fine-tune when it’s a very narrow problem, and where I think it’s going to fit in a small model.\nHamel Husain"

You should have a clear distinction between them.\nIt is hard to write great answers, but we are good at evaluating which ones we prefer. There are many algorithms to implement those preferences. Currently, the one that seems to work best is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nRemark: the 23rd of May, 2024, an article was published on a new algorithm found to be both simpler and more effective than DPO: Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO). This is very new at the time of writing (25th of May, 2024), so we will have to wait and see how it really performs.\n\nWhat is DPO?\nBasically, instead of linking a single output to a prompt, you will create a dataset with a prompt and a preference between two outputs: a chosen response and a rejected response.\nSee more:\n\nThe original article on the DPO algorithm (Rafailov et al., 2023).\nA practical example of DPO with the TRL library from HuggingFace\n\n\n\nPractical Application and Comparison of DPO\nThe use case was to automate responses to incoming emails.
